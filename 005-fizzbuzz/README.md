# The Classic FizzBuzz!

## Directions

Write a program that console logs the numbers from 1 to n. But for multiples of three print “fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “fizzbuzz”.

## Examples

```javascript
> fizzBuzz(15);
1
2
fizz
4
buzz
fizz
7
8
fizz
buzz
11
fizz
13
14
fizzbuzz
```
